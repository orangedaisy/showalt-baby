      <p>By this week, your baby weighs 2 1/4 pounds (about the size of a large eggplant)
        and measures 14.8 inches from the top of their head to their heels. They can
        blink their eyes, which now sport lashes. With their eyesight developing, they
        may be able to see the light that filters in through your womb. They&#39;re also
        developing billions of neurons in their brain and adding more body fat in
        preparation for life in the outside world.</p>

      <blockquote>
      <p>This week, your baby weighs almost 2 pounds (about the size of a head of
        cauliflower) and is about 14 1/2 inches long with their legs extended. They&#39;re
        sleeping and waking at regular intervals, opening and closing their eyes, and
        perhaps even sucking their fingers. With more brain tissue developing, your
        baby&#39;s brain is very active now. While their lungs are still immature, they
        would be capable of functioning &mdash; with a lot of medical help &mdash; if
        they were to be born now. Chalk up any tiny rhythmic movements you may be feeling
        to a case of baby hiccups, which may be common from now on. Each episode usually
        lasts only a few moments, and they don&#39;t bother them, so just relax and enjoy
        the tickle.</p>

      <p>The network of nerves in your baby&#39;s ears is better developed and more
        sensitive than before. They may now be able to hear both your voice and your
        partner&#39;s as you chat with each other. They&#39;re inhaling and exhaling small
        amounts of amniotic fluid, which is essential for the development of their lungs.
        These so-called breathing movements are also good practice for when they&#39;re born
        and take that first gulp of air. Your baby is continuing to put on baby fat.
        They now weigh about 1 2/3 pounds and measure 14 inches (about the size of a
        scallion) from head to heel.</p>

      <p>Head to heels, your baby now measures about 13 1/2 inches. Their weight &mdash;
        1 1/2 pounds &mdash; isn&#39;t much more than an average rutabaga, but they&#39;re
        beginning to exchange their long, lean look for some baby fat. As they do, their
        wrinkled skin will begin to smooth out and they&#39;ll start to look more and more
        like a newborn. They&#39;re also growing more hair — and if you could see it, you&#39;d
        now be able to discern its color and texture.</p>

      <blockquote>
      <p>Your baby&#39;s growing steadily, having gained about 4 ounces since last week.
        That puts them at about 1 1/3 pounds. Since they&#39;re almost a foot long (about
        the size of an ear of corn), they cut a pretty lean figure at this point, but
        their body is filling out proportionally and they&#39;ll soon start to plump up.
        Their brain is also growing quickly now, and their taste buds are continuing
        to develop. Their lungs are developing &quot;branches&quot; of the respiratory &quot;tree&quot; as
        well as cells that produce surfactant, a substance that will help their air
        sacs inflate once they hit the outside world. Their skin is still thin and
        translucent, but that will start to change soon.</p>

      <p>Turn on the radio and sway to the music. With their sense of movement well
        developed by now, your baby can feel you dance. And now that they&#39;re more than
        11 inches long and weigh just over a pound (the size of a large mango), you may
        be able to see them squirm underneath your clothes. Blood vessels in their lungs
        are developing to prepare for breathing, and the sounds that your baby&#39;s
        increasingly keen ears pick up are preparing them for entry into the outside
        world. Loud noises that become familiar now &mdash; such as your dog barking
        or the roar of the vacuum cleaner &mdash; probably won&#39;t faze them when they
        hear them outside the womb.</p>

      <p>At 11 inches and almost 1 pound (about the size of a spaghetti squash), your
        baby is starting to look like a miniature newborn. Their lips, eyelids, and eyebrows
        are becoming more distinct, and they&#39;re even developing tiny tooth buds beneath
        their gums. Their eyes have formed, but their irises (the colored part of the
        eye) still lack pigment.</p>
      <p>If you could see inside your womb, you&#39;d be able to spot the fine hair that
        covers their body and the deep wrinkles on their skin, which they&#39;ll sport until
        they add a padding of fat to fill them in. Inside their belly, their pancreas
        &mdash; essential for the production of some important hormones &mdash; is
        developing steadily.</p>

      <p>Your baby now weighs about three-quarters of a pound and is approximately 10 1/2
        inches long — about the size of a carrot. You may soon feel like they&#39;re practicing
        martial arts as their initial fluttering movements turn into full-fledged kicks
        and nudges. You may also discover a pattern to their activity as you get to know
        them better. In other developments, your baby&#39;s eyebrows and lids are present now,
        and if you&#39;re having a girl, her vagina has begun to form as well.</p>
