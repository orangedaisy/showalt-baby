  ### Week 34

  ###### April 11, 2016

  > Your baby now weighs about 4<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> pounds (about the
  size of a cantaloupe) and is almost 18 inches long. Their fat layers &mdash;
  which will help regulate body temperature once they're born &mdash; are filling
  out, making them rounder. Their skin is also smoother than ever. Their central
  nervous system is maturing and their lungs are continuing to mature as well. If
  you've been nervous about preterm labor, you'll be happy to know that babies
  born between 34 and 37 weeks who have no other health problems generally do fine.
  They may need a short stay in the neonatal nursery and may have a few short-term
  health issues, but in the long run, they usually do as well as full-term babies.

  ### Week 33

  ###### April 4, 2016

  > This week your baby weighs a little over 4 pounds and has passed the 17-inch
  mark (about the size of a pineapple). They're rapidly losing that wrinkled, alien
  look and their skeleton is hardening. The bones in their skull aren't fused
  together, which allows them to move and slightly overlap, thus making it easier
  for them to fit through the birth canal &mdash; the pressure on the head during
  birth is so intense that many babies are born with a conehead-like appearance.
  These bones don't entirely fuse until early adulthood, so they can grow as their
  brain and other tissue expands during infancy and childhood.

  ### Week 32

  ###### March 28, 2016

  > By now, your baby weighs 3 <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> pounds (about the
  size of a large jicama) and is about 16.7 inches long, taking up a lot of space
  in your uterus. You're gaining about a pound a week and roughly half of that goes
  right to your baby. They'll gain a third to half of their birth weight during the
  next 7 weeks as they fatten up for survival outside the womb. They now have
  toenails, fingernails, and real hair (or at least respectable peach fuzz). Their
  skin is becoming soft and smooth as they plump up in preparation for birth.

  ### Week 31

  ###### March 21, 2016

  > This week, your baby measures over 16 inches long. They weigh about 3<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub>
  pounds (about the size of a coconut) and are heading into a growth spurt. They
  can turn their head from side to side, and their arms, legs, and body are
  beginning to plump out as needed fat accumulates underneath their skin. They're
  probably moving a lot, too, so you may have trouble sleeping because your baby's
  kicks and somersaults keep you up. Take comfort: All this moving is a sign that
  your baby is active and healthy.

  ### Week 30

  ###### March 14, 2016

  10 weeks left!!

  > Your baby is about 15.7 inches long now and weighs almost 3 pounds (about the
  size of a large cabbage). A pint and a half of amniotic fluid surrounds them,
  but that volume will shrink as they get bigger and take up more room in your
  uterus. Their eyesight continues to develop, though it's not very keen; even
  after they're born, they'll keep their eyes closed for a good part of the day.
  When they do open them, they'll respond to changes in light but will have 20/400
  vision &mdash; which means they can only make out objects a few inches from their
  face (normal adult vision is 20/20).

  ### Week 29

  ###### March 7, 2016

  > Your baby now weighs about 2&frac12; pounds (about the size of a butternut squash)
  and is a tad over 15 inches long from head to heel. Their muscles and lungs are
  continuing to mature, and their head is growing bigger to make room for their
  developing brain. To meet their increasing nutritional demands, you'll need
  plenty of protein, vitamins C, folic acid, and iron. And because their bones are
  soaking up lots of calcium, be sure to drink your milk (or find another good
  source of calcium, such as cheese, yogurt, or enriched orange juice). This
  trimester, about 250 milligrams of calcium are deposited in your baby's
  hardening skeleton each day.

  ### Week 28

  ###### February 29, 2016

  > By this week, your baby weighs 2&frac14; pounds (about the size of a large eggplant)
  and measures 14.8 inches from the top of their head to their heels. They can
  blink their eyes, which now sport lashes. With their eyesight developing, they
  may be able to see the light that filters in through your womb. They're also
  developing billions of neurons in their brain and adding more body fat in
  preparation for life in the outside world.

  ### Week 27

  ###### February 22, 2016

  > This week, your baby weighs almost 2 pounds (about the size of a head of
  cauliflower) and is about 14&frac12; inches long with their legs extended. They're
  sleeping and waking at regular intervals, opening and closing their eyes, and
  perhaps even sucking their fingers. With more brain tissue developing, your
  baby's brain is very active now. While their lungs are still immature, they
  would be capable of functioning &mdash; with a lot of medical help &mdash; if
  they were to be born now. Chalk up any tiny rhythmic movements you may be feeling
  to a case of baby hiccups, which may be common from now on. Each episode usually
  lasts only a few moments, and they don't bother them, so just relax and enjoy
  the tickle.

  ### Week 26

  ###### February 15, 2016

  > The network of nerves in your baby's ears is better developed and more
  sensitive than before. They may now be able to hear both your voice and your
  partner's as you chat with each other. They're inhaling and exhaling small
  amounts of amniotic fluid, which is essential for the development of their lungs.
  These so-called breathing movements are also good practice for when they're born
  and take that first gulp of air. Your baby is continuing to put on baby fat.
  They now weigh about 1<sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> pounds and measure 14
  inches (about the size of a scallion) from head to heel.

  ### Week 25

  ###### February 8, 2016

  > Head to heels, your baby now measures about 13&frac12; inches. Their weight &mdash;
  1&frac12; pounds &mdash; isn't much more than an average rutabaga, but they're
  beginning to exchange their long, lean look for some baby fat. As they do, their
  wrinkled skin will begin to smooth out and they'll start to look more and more
  like a newborn. They're also growing more hair â€” and if you could see it, you'd
  now be able to discern its color and texture.

  ### Week 24

  ###### February 1, 2016

  > Your baby's growing steadily, having gained about 4 ounces since last week.
  That puts them at about 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> pounds. Since they're
  almost a foot long (about the size of an ear of corn), they cut a pretty lean
  figure at this point, but their body is filling out proportionally and they'll
  soon start to plump up.  Their brain is also growing quickly now, and their
  taste buds are continuing to develop. Their lungs are developing "branches" of
  the respiratory "tree" as well as cells that produce surfactant, a substance
  that will help their air sacs inflate once they hit the outside world. Their
  skin is still thin and translucent, but that will start to change soon.

  ### Week 23

  ###### January 25, 2016

  > Turn on the radio and sway to the music. With their sense of movement well
  developed by now, your baby can feel you dance. And now that they're more than
  11 inches long and weigh just over a pound (the size of a large mango), you may
  be able to see them squirm underneath your clothes. Blood vessels in their lungs
  are developing to prepare for breathing, and the sounds that your baby's
  increasingly keen ears pick up are preparing them for entry into the outside
  world. Loud noises that become familiar now &mdash; such as your dog barking
  or the roar of the vacuum cleaner &mdash; probably won't faze them when they
  hear them outside the womb.

  ### Week 22

  ###### January 18, 2016

  > At 11 inches and almost 1 pound (about the size of a spaghetti squash), your
  baby is starting to look like a miniature newborn. Their lips, eyelids, and eyebrows
  are becoming more distinct, and they're even developing tiny tooth buds beneath
  their gums. Their eyes have formed, but their irises (the colored part of the
  eye) still lack pigment.

  > If you could see inside your womb, you'd be able to spot the fine hair that
  covers their body and the deep wrinkles on their skin, which they'll sport until
  they add a padding of fat to fill them in. Inside their belly, their pancreas
  &mdash; essential for the production of some important hormones &mdash; is
  developing steadily.

  ### Week 21

  ###### January 11, 2016

  > Your baby now weighs about three-quarters of a pound and is approximately 10&frac12;
  inches long â€” about the size of a carrot. You may soon feel like they're practicing
  martial arts as their initial fluttering movements turn into full-fledged kicks
  and nudges. You may also discover a pattern to their activity as you get to know
  them better. In other developments, your baby's eyebrows and lids are present now,
  and if you're having a girl, her vagina has begun to form as well.
