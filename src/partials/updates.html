  ### Week 21
  
  ###### January 11, 2016

  > Your baby now weighs about three-quarters of a pound and is approximately 10 1/2
  inches long â€” about the size of a carrot. You may soon feel like they're practicing
  martial arts as their initial fluttering movements turn into full-fledged kicks
  and nudges. You may also discover a pattern to their activity as you get to know
  them better. In other developments, your baby's eyebrows and lids are present now,
  and if you're having a girl, her vagina has begun to form as well.
